She holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Vienna in Philosophy and a master's degree in History and Philosophy of Science. During her studies she focused on human enhancement technologies, (digital) infrastructures and language as key parts of human interaction and society.

As repairwork is part of the Viennese culture regarding Freuds concepts of self-repair in a psychoanalytical sense she detected early on, that repair work is more than fixing kitchen gadgets, broken windows, cars, trainlines and airplanes. Repair and maintenance work are parts of daily life and daily practice concerning diverse spheres from the self on to physical occurences. Repairwork means taking care of people, things and in-betweens. Repair can enhance, fix and develop human culture. As she is a naturally curious character, she decided  to be part of a research team, with a diverse and broad scientific background to pursue the question if we- as human beings- can literally fix human society.
