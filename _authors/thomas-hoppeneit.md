**Thomas Hoppenheit** is a PhD Candidate at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH). Within the FNR funded project “Repairing technology – fixing society? History of maintenance and repair in Luxembourg (1918 – 1990)” he is researching the development of urban repair networks in the city of Luxembourg and Esch-sur-Alzette.

He holds a Bachelor degree in Sociology and Cultural/Social Anthropology as well as a Master degree in Social Anthropology from Münster University (Germany). With his main interests in the broader field of technology and culture from use to repair and beyond, he wrote his Master dissertation on “Digital Networks in Estonia” after six months of qualitative field research.

Personally, technology fascinates Thomas ever since the first family computer was brought home. What started as an outlet for his early tinkering, soon became so much more once it got connected to the Internet. Thus being afforded to follow every trail of thought, if nobody else needed to use the phone at the same time, it led to many a sleepless night. Once this early fascination wore off, the hardware became the focus in itself – as once you want to customize, you need the know-how to maintain and repair. From then until today his story is one of cheesy 90’s hacker movies, amateur programming and lot of time spent debugging code, a visceral need to screw around (pun intended) with every object that shows first signs of not working properly anymore and a deeply rooted interest in peoples’ stories.
